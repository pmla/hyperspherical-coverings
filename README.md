# hyperspherical-coverings
Orientation sets created via solution of the hyperspherical covering problem

Program overview:

Orientation sets can be generated by running 'main.py'.  The script creates a flat file with the chosen Laue group and granularity.  All orientations are in the fundamental zone of the chosen Laue group.  By default each orientation is stored as a quaternion.  The output format is 4 floats (16 bytes in total) per quaternion.

Options:

--matrix: convert each orientation to a 3x3 rotation matrix, stored using 9 floats (36 bytes in total).

--weights: output the Voronoi cell of each orientation.  This appends a single float to each orientation.

--print: print the output to the terminal (stdout) rather than saving it to a file.



Examples:
(alpha denotes maximum misorientation of set)


Create file with alpha<=2 degrees for D3 Laue group

python main.py D3 2


Create file with alpha<=4 degrees for O Laue group.  Append Voronoi cell weights

python main.py O 4 --weights


Create file with alpha<=1 degrees for C2 Laue group.  Store orientations as rotation matrices.  Print data to screen rather than saving to a file.

python main.py C2 1 --matrix --print
