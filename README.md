# hyperspherical-coverings
Orientation sets created via solution of the hyperspherical covering problem


Program overview:

Orientation sets can be generated by running 'main.py'.  The script prints orientations (to stdout) with the chosen Laue group and granularity.  All orientations are in the fundamental zone of the chosen Laue group.

Arguments:

lauegroup: desired Laue group (options are [C1i, C2h, C3i, C4h, C6h, D2h, D3d, D4h, D6h, Th, Oh])

alpha: maximum misorientation of set (options are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

outputformat: specifies the output format (options are [quaternion, euler, matrix])


Optional arguments:

--weights: output the Voronoi cell of each orientation.


Examples:

Create orientation set with alpha<=2 degrees for D3 Laue group, in quaternion form

python main.py D3d 2 quaternion


Create orientation set with alpha<=4 degrees for O Laue group, in Euler angle form.  Append Voronoi cell weights

python main.py Oh 4 euler --weights


Create orientation set with alpha<=1 degrees for C2 Laue group, in rotation matrix form.

python main.py C2h 1 matrix
